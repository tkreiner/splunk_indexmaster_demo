# In distributed environments, it's common to have a lone search head acting
# as the license master as well. In this configuration, providing the URI
# of the license master is easiest within the indexer_base configuration.
# In the event that there are multiple search heads, you could instead use
# the org_all_license app, shipped to the non-license SH, as well as all of
# the indexers. In either event, the settings are the same.

# Example: master_uri = https://license.master.example.com:8089
master_uri = https://{{fqdn-license-master}}:{{mgmt_port}}
